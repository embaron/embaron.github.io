    <h3>Original Plan</h3>
      <p>I like data. I like visualizing data and collecting data. I like all sorts of data. I also like the idea of hyper-personalized apps. My first idea for this project was to have a way to keep track of my personal food data including frequently bought grocery items, restaurants eaten at, and recipes made. 

      After a rough post-it note app map, I realized the "restaurants eaten at" feature was too intensive for what I wanted to do, plus there's already a <em>pretty</em> <a href="www.yelp.com"> company already established and doing just that.</a></p>

    <h3>More Iteration</h3>
    <p>After some user testing, I found that the grocery item feature was a dud. I continued playing with it but it just didn't work for what I wanted to do, thus I decided on a personal cookbook.</p>

    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p>A personal cookbook is not the most original idea, but I will continue to work on Tried and True in the future. I plan on adding more data-driven features along the lines of being able to keep track of how many times I've made a specific recipe. I would also like to add an OCR feature to scan recipes, as well as a way to export recipes from website to Tried and True.</p>
