        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>My name is Emily Baron and I am a front end web developer. I began
        learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Codecademy while in college.
        I have since immersed myself into the world of front-end development,
        building personal projects as seen on my <a href="https://www.github.com/embaron">github</a> and learning new languages and skills. 
        <br>
        <br> In addition to development, I enjoy photography and design, skills that have helped me in the composition aspect of web design. Be sure to check out examples of my work below.</p>
