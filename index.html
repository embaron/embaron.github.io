        Hello! My name is Emily Baron and I am a front end web developer. I began
        learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while in college and have since
        immersed myself into the world of front-end development, building
        personal projects and learning new languages and skills. 
        <br>
        <br> In addition to development, I enjoy photography and digital design, skills
        that have helped me immensely in designing websites. </p>

          <p>I am always trying to learn new skills and I keep most of my
          projects on my github page. You can see various projects I've worked
          on including a local weather app, random quote generator, and a rock,
          paper, scissors game.</p><a href="https://github.com/embaron">View

            <p> I have been passionate about photography ever since I got my
            first camera at age 11. I have since photographed everything from
            Division I college football games on the sidelines to Olympic
            whitewater kayak trials to panoramas from the top of mountains in
            Maine. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/emily3333000">See more photos here</a>.
