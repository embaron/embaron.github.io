        <p>My name is Emily Baron and I am a front end web developer. I began
        learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while in college and have since immersed myself into the world of front-end development, building personal projects as seen on my <a href="https://www.github.com/embaron">github</a> and learning new languages and skills. 
        <br>
        <br> In addition to development, I enjoy photography and digital design, skills
        that have helped me immensely in designing websites. Be sure to check out examples of my work below.</p>

            <p> I have been passionate about photography ever since I got my
            first camera at age 11. I have since photographed everything from
            Division I college football games on the sidelines to Olympic
            whitewater kayak trials to panoramas from the top of mountains in
            Maine. <a
